# MetaFINKI <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/KFE_LpbQZ7oAAAAd/loading-load.gif" alt="Loading" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;">

This project is part of the Digitalization course and aims to create a 3D model of the FINKI building using Blender. The motivation behind this project comes from the fact that FINKI does not have an official building representation, and I want to create a digital version for educational and virtual exploration purposes. The project is currently in its early stages and will be actively developed in the coming months. <b>Stay tuned for updates!</b>

## Status:
- Active work will begin in 1-2 months.
- Objective: To create a digital representation of the FINKI building, providing a 3D model for the faculty and future virtual use.
