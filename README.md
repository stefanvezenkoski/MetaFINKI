This project is part of the Digitalization course and aims to create a 3D model of the FINKI building using Blender.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project comes from the fact that FINKI does not have an official building representation, and I want to create a digital version for educational and virtual exploration purposes. 
## Status
The project is in its early stages.

ðŸ‘· Active development will begin in 1-2 months.

## Objective
To deliver a high-quality 3D model of the FINKI building that can be used for:

- Educational purposes
- Virtual exploration
- Future virtual reality or simulation applications


<h2>Stay Tuned! ðŸš€</h2>
