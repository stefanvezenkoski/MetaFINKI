# MetaFINKI: 3D Model of the FINKI Building ðŸš€

Due to the large size of the .blend file, you can view the full project at the following link:  [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1an9xC-bBW2eGpACpagVCNyltI-dhCQcx).

## About the Project
This project, created as part of the Digitization course, involves crafting a 3D model of the FINKI building using Blender. The aim is to produce a detailed and accurate model that can serve various purposes in educational and virtual contexts.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project comes from the fact that FINKI does not have an official building representation, and I wanted to create a digital version for educational and virtual exploration purposes. 

## Objective
The goal is to deliver a high-quality, realistic 3D model of the FINKI building, which can be used for:

- Educational purposes
- Virtual exploration
- Future virtual reality or simulation applications
